📌 Project Overview

Credit Risk Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting credit risk using various customer and financial data points. The model aims to assess the likelihood of loan default, helping financial institutions make data-driven lending decisions. It includes Jupyter notebooks with end-to-end workflows, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. The project connects to a PostgreSQL database for automatic updates when new data is uploaded.
